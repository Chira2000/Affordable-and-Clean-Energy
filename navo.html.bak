       <h1>Adverse effects of not using this <b>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 7</b></h1>
      <p> <b>SDG 7</b> seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. This means doubling the global rate of energy efficiency improvements, as well as substantially increasing the percentage of renewables in the energy mix. We cannot maintain our quality of life or Earth's ecosystems unless we acknowledge and reduce the damage we do to the planet each day. If we don't learn to live sustainably, some of the effects will be: More landfills popping up everywhere. More animals going extinct due to deforestation and pollution. There is no development without fuelling the engine of growth. Energy is critical and people with no sustainable access to energy are deprived of the opportunity to become part of national and global progress. And yet, one billion people around the world live without access to energy.
  </p>
<h2><strong><em>Therefore, if sdg 7 affordable and clean energy is not used sustainably, it will have to face the following effects.</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
	<li> Indoor air pollution and Urban air pollution</li>
	<li>Climate change</li>
	<li>Environmental degradation</li> 
	<li>Expencive storage costs</li>
	<li>Solid waste disposal</li>
	<li>Fuel spills or natural gas leaks</li>
	<li>Emissions of greenhouse gases</li>
	<li>Most non renewable energy resources produce Carbondipxide as a byproduct</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indoor air pollution and Urban air pollution:challenges and opportunity</h2>
	<p>With the continual improvement in our quality of life, indoor air quality has become an important area of concern in the twenty-first century. Indoor air quality is affected by many factors including the type and running conditions of indoor pollution sources, ventilation conditions, as well as indoor activities. Studies revealed that the outdoor environment is also an important factor that cannot be neglected for indoor air quality studies. In this review, the indoor and outdoor air pollution relationships obtained from different studies are discussed in order to identify the key factors affecting the indoor air quality. As climate change is recognized as imposing impacts on the environment, how it affects the indoor air quality and the health impacts to the occupants will be evaluated in this paper. The major challenges and opportunities in indoor/outdoor air pollution studies will be highlighted.</p>
		<h2>Introduction<h2>
		<p>With rapid development of the economy and booming population growth, an enormous amount of resources (e.g., energy, water, and food) is required in our society to sustain our activities. As a result, various kinds of pollution have been produced. Among the various pollution problems, air pollution has caused major concern over the world due to its widespread nature, damage to our environment and potential health risk to humans. Although concern has been raised regarding the emission of air pollutants from anthropogenic sources, our society still relies heavily on fossil fuels for various applications such as electricity generation, transportation, industrial and domestic heating, and so on. An obvious result of this is the deterioration of our air quality, particularly in developing countries. Air pollution has become a public concerned problem in modern metropolises. Numerous studies in physics, chemistry, geography, and other relevant areas have been conducted to investigate the cause and seriousness of the air pollution problems (Seinfeld, 1986). At the same time, the issue of indoor air pollution also piqued the interest of many scientists, as people spend most of their time (>80%) indoors (Jenkins et al., 1992). Although the time people spent indoors varies with season, age, gender, type of work, health conditions of inhabitants, and so on, good air quality can safeguard the health of the occupants and increase the productivity of workers. Apparently, indoor air quality should be better than outdoor air quality due to the shielding effect of buildings and possible installation of ventilation and air cleaning devices. However, for those combined indoor and outdoor air quality studies in literature, more than 2/3 have found indoor air pollutant concentration higher than outdoor (Chen and Zhao, 2011). This indicates the importance of conducting more studies in order to enhance our understanding on the cause of problems and associated remedial measures. Meanwhile, the number of publications related to indoor air pollution has increased tremendously in recent decades. Many studies have confirmed that indoor air quality is highly affected by outdoor air quality. Therefore, to solve our pollution problems, both indoor and outdoor environment should be considered. In this paper, various issues of indoor air quality and how it is affected by the outdoor air quality in urban environment will be discussed.</P>
		
	
		<h3>Outdoor Environment</h3>
			<p>Outdoor air pollutants mainly consist of NOx, SO2, O3, CO, HC, and particulate matters (PM) of different particle sizes. In urban areas, these pollutants are mainly emitted from on-road and off-road vehicles, but there are also contributions from power plants, industrial boilers, incinerators, petrochemical plants, aircrafts, ships and so on, depending on the locations and prevailing winds. Comparatively, the contribution from cross border sources is less significant in urban areas due to its increased distance from the pollution sources. However, urban air quality is highly affected by city design. Densely distributed and deep street canyons (buildings with large building height to road width ratios) can block and weaken the approaching wind, thus reducing its air dispersion capability (Cheng et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009, 2010). On the other hand, good urban design can disperse air pollutants and alleviate the problems of air pollutant accumulation (Li et al., 2005, 2009; Santamouris, 2013).</P>
