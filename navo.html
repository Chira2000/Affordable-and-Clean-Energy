       <h1>Adverse effects of not using this <b>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 7</b></h1>
      <p> <b>SDG 7</b> seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. This means doubling the global rate of energy efficiency improvements, as well as substantially increasing the percentage of renewables in the energy mix. We cannot maintain our quality of life or Earth's ecosystems unless we acknowledge and reduce the damage we do to the planet each day. If we don't learn to live sustainably, some of the effects will be: More landfills popping up everywhere. More animals going extinct due to deforestation and pollution. There is no development without fuelling the engine of growth. Energy is critical and people with no sustainable access to energy are deprived of the opportunity to become part of national and global progress. And yet, one billion people around the world live without access to energy.
  </p>
<h2><strong><em>Therefore, if sdg 7 affordable and clean energy is not used sustainably, it will have to face the following effects.</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
	<li> Indoor air pollution and Urban air pollution</li>
	<li>Climate change</li>
	<li>Environmental degradation</li> 
	<li>Expencive storage costs</li>
	<li>Solid waste disposal</li>
	<li>Fuel spills or natural gas leaks</li>
	<li>Emissions of greenhouse gases</li>
	<li>Most non renewable energy resources produce Carbondipxide as a byproduct</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indoor air pollution and Urban air pollution</h2>
	<p>With the continual improvement in our quality of life, indoor air quality has become an important area of concern in the twenty-first century. Indoor air quality is affected by many factors including the type and running conditions of indoor pollution sources, ventilation conditions, as well as indoor activities. Studies revealed that the outdoor environment is also an important factor that cannot be neglected for indoor air quality studies. In this review, the indoor and outdoor air pollution relationships obtained from different studies are discussed in order to identify the key factors affecting the indoor air quality. As climate change is recognized as imposing impacts on the environment, how it affects the indoor air quality and the health impacts to the occupants will be evaluated in this paper. The major challenges and opportunities in indoor/outdoor air pollution studies will be highlighted.</p>
		<h3>Outdoor Environment</h3>
			<p>Outdoor air pollutants mainly consist of NOx, SO2, O3, CO, HC, and particulate matters (PM) of different particle sizes. In urban areas, these pollutants are mainly emitted from on-road and off-road vehicles, but there are also contributions from power plants, industrial boilers, incinerators, petrochemical plants, aircrafts, ships and so on, depending on the locations and prevailing winds. Comparatively, the contribution from cross border sources is less significant in urban areas due to its increased distance from the pollution sources. However, urban air quality is highly affected by city design. Densely distributed and deep street canyons (buildings with large building height to road width ratios) can block and weaken the approaching wind, thus reducing its air dispersion capability (Cheng et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009, 2010). On the other hand, good urban design can disperse air pollutants and alleviate the problems of air pollutant accumulation (Li et al., 2005, 2009; Santamouris, 2013).</P>
