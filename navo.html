       <h1>Adverse effects of not using this <b>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 7</b></h1>
      <p> <b>SDG 7</b> seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. This means doubling the global rate of energy efficiency improvements, as well as substantially increasing the percentage of renewables in the energy mix. We cannot maintain our quality of life or Earth's ecosystems unless we acknowledge and reduce the damage we do to the planet each day. If we don't learn to live sustainably, some of the effects will be: More landfills popping up everywhere. More animals going extinct due to deforestation and pollution. There is no development without fuelling the engine of growth. Energy is critical and people with no sustainable access to energy are deprived of the opportunity to become part of national and global progress. And yet, one billion people around the world live without access to energy.
  </p>
<h2><strong><em>Therefore, if sdg 7 affordable and clean energy is not used sustainably, it will have to face the following effects.</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
	<li> Indoor air pollution and Urban air pollution</li>
	<li>Climate change</li>
	<li>Environmental degradation</li> 
	<li>Expencive storage costs</li>
	<li>Solid waste disposal</li>
	<li>Fuel spills or natural gas leaks</li>
	<li>Emissions of greenhouse gases</li>
	<li>Most non renewable energy resources produce Carbondipxide as a byproduct</li>
</ul>
