This means doubling the global rate of energy efficiency improvements, as well as substantially increasing the percentage of renewables in the energy mix. We cannot maintain our quality of life or Earth's ecosystems unless we acknowledge and reduce the damage we do to the planet each day. If we don't learn to live sustainably, some of the effects will be: More landfills popping up everywhere. More animals going extinct due to deforestation and pollution. There is no development without fuelling the engine of growth.

<h1 style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Indoor Air Pollution and Urban Air Pollution</strong></h1>
	<p style="font-size:20px">
	<strong>What are the main causes of air pollution in Sri Lanka? Air quality in Sri Lanka is affected by vehicle emissions, organic waste burning,by-products from the agricultural industry, and petroleum refining. Availabledata indicates that Colombo often experiences high levels of air pollution.<br>Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires.Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). ... Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution.</p>
		</strong>
		
		
		
		<p style="font-size:20px"><strong>Indoor air pollution is dust, dirt, or gases in the air inside buildings such as your home or workplace that could be harmful to breathe in. Poor indoor air quality has been linked to lung diseases like asthma, COPD and lung cancer. It has also been linked to increased risk of heart disease and stroke.</strong></P>

		<h3 style="color:peru;">Outdoor Environment</h3>
			
			 <p style="color:black; font-size:20px;"><strong>Outdoor air pollutants mainly consist of NOx, SO2, O3, CO, HC, and particulate matters (PM) of different particle sizes. In urban areas, these pollutants are mainly emitted from on-road and off-road vehicles, but there are also contributions from power plants, industrial boilers, incinerators, petrochemical plants, aircrafts, ships and so on, depending on the locations and prevailing winds. Comparatively, the contribution from cross border sources is less significant in urban areas due to its increased distance from the pollution sources. However, urban air quality is highly affected by city design. Densely distributed and deep street canyons (buildings with large building height to road width ratios) can block and weaken the approaching wind, thus reducing its air dispersion capability (Cheng et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009, 2010). On the other hand, good urban design can disperse air pollutants and alleviate the problems of air pollutant accumulation (Li et al., 2005, 2009; Santamouris, 2013).</strong></P>
			

		<h3 style="color:peru;">Indoor Air Pollutants and Sources</h3>
		<h4 style="color:black;">Indoor Air Pollutants</h4>
		<p style="color:red;  font-size:20px;"><strong>
	A number of air pollutants have been recognized to exist indoors, including NOx, SO2, O3, CO, volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PM, radon, and microorganism. Some of these pollutants (e.g., NOx, SO2, O3, PM) are common to both indoor and outdoor environments, and some of them may be originated from outdoors. These air pollutants can be inorganic, organic, biological or even radioactive. The effect of these air pollutants on humans depends on their toxicity, concentration and exposure time, and may vary from person to person. The most common effect is called sick building syndrome (SBS), in which people experience uncomfortable or acute health effects such as irritation of nose, eyes and throat, skin ailments, allergies, and so on. The cause may not be identified, but the syndrome may disappear after an affected person leaves the office or building. Indoor air quality can be improved and SBS can be reduced when the ventilation rate of the room is improved (Wargocki et al., 2000). The indoor air quality also affects the performance of workers and office staff. Wyon (2004) found that the performance of real office work would be significantly and substantially affected by changes in indoor environmental quality and that the work performance could be significantly enhanced by removing common indoor sources of air pollution.</strong></p>
	<h4 style="color:black;">Sources of Indoor Air Pollutants</h4>
	<p style="color:red; font-size:20px;"><strong>Table 1 shows the source of various indoor air pollutants, and their health impacts. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 3 billion people in the world still cook and heat their homes using dirty solid fuels (such as waste wood, charcoal, coal, dung, crop wastes) on open fireplaces, cooking stoves or kangs, which generates a large amount of air pollutants (such as SO2, NOx, CO, and PM). Even worse is that these air pollutants may accumulate in the indoor environment if the indoor air is not well ventilated, which seriously affects the health of the inhabitants (WHO, 2014). There are also many anthropogenic sources (such as wooden construction materials, oil based paints, fragrant decorations, and indoor plants) emitting VOCs at a variety of concentrations. These VOCs (such as formaldehyde) may be carcinogenic, while some of them (such as turpenes) may react with ozone to form secondary fine suspended indoor particles (Weschler and Shields, 1999). Wallace (1985) indicated that many indoor sources of toxic organics exist among thousands of consumer products and building materials. Radon, a colorless carcinogenic radioactive gas and the second most important cause of lung cancer in many countries (EPA, 2014a), causes problem in many houses built with stony construction materials or basements with poor ventilation. There are also biological sources including pets, dust mites and humans. The existence of these indoor air pollutants increases the risk of people with breathing problems, such as asthma sufferers, and with compromised or underdeveloped immune systems.</strong></p>

<p style="color:sienna; font-size:20px;">This indicates that indoor pollution sources, ventilation conditions, and even the outdoor environment can affect indoor air pollution. In recent years, there have been an increasing number of studies on the relationship between indoor and outdoor air pollutant concentrations under different conditions.

<h1 style="color:black; text-decoration:underline;">Climate Change</h1>
<h2 style="color:red;">Causes and Consequences of Climate Change </h2>
<h3 style="color:brown;">The “greenhouse effect”</h3>
<p style=font-size:20px;">Human activity is the main cause of climate change. People burn fossil fuels and convert land from forests to agriculture. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, people have burned more and more fossil fuels and changed vast areas of land from forests to farmland.According to scientists this is due to the increase in the greenhouse gasses (global) as well as the rapid urbanization causing the heat effect (local). The mean annual temperature in the country is expected to increase in the near future (2030), and to possibly increase even more in the years surrounding 2050.</p></div>
<img src="Illustration-of-the-greenhouse-effect.png" alt="trulli" width="1000" height="600">
<p>Source: IPCC WG1 AR4 SPM</P>
<h3>The National found out the five main culprits for this increase in greenhouse gases</h3>
<ul style="color:black;">
	<li>Fossil fuels. Expand Autoplay</li>
	<li>Deforestation</li>
	<li>Increasing livestock farming</li>
	<li>Fertilisers containing nitrogen</li>
	<li>Fluorinated gases</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color:Maroon; text-decoration:underline;">Projections of future ‘climate conflicts’ and the SDGs</h3>
<p style="color:MidnightBlue; font-size:20px;">There exists an extremely small number of studies making projections on future climateconflicts. On the one hand, Burke et al (2009) predict that if future conflicts in sub-Saharan
Africa are on average as deadly as present conflicts, and assuming linear increases intemperature to 2030, this warming will increase armed conflict incidence by roughly 54%, or
an additional 393,000 battle deaths by 2030. On the other hand, based on a statistical modelof the historical effect of key socioeconomic variables on country-specific conflict incidence
for the period 1960–2013, Hegre et al (2015) forecast the annual incidence of conflict for the 2014–2100 period along the five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). They show that
broader socioeconomic development, expressed by higher growth in education and povertyalleviation, could help in offsetting most of the conflict risk in developing countries associated
with reduced economic growth due to implementation of policies to curb GHG emissions.However, predictions based on historical models provide a weak foundation for projecting
future conflict risk under future climate scenarios since we do not know how conflict patternswill evolve over time under anthropogenic climate change. Research needs to simulate future
conflict risk along alternative configurations of representative concentration pathways andshared socioeconomic pathways, while at the same time accounting for feedbacks from
conflict onto economic activity.Although climatic conditions seem to affect the characteristics of conflict, in particular
duration and intensity, rather than its onset, they can still endanger the successfulimplementation not only of SDG 13 but almost all SDGs. Conflict is development in reverse:
conflict does not only undermine the capacity of governments (and non-governmental actors)to reduce greenhouse emissions and to provide adequate protection from natural disasters,
but it is also a major driver of climatic/environmental vulnerability via its negative effects oneconomic growth, education, food security, and environmental destruction. Hence, ending
violent conflict may be one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways to improve socialresilience to natural disasters and climate change in general.</p>
