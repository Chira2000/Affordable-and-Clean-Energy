      <h1>Importance of Affordable & Clean Energy</h1>
      <p>  <h3> What is the goal here?</h3>
            To ensure access to affortable,reliable, susntanable and modern energy for all.
         </p>
         <p> <h2>Why?</h2>
        Our everyday lives depend on reliable and affordable energy services to function smoothly and to  equitably.
    A well-established energy system supports all sectors: from busineses,medicine and education to agriculture,greenhouse gases which cause climate chage and harmfull impacts on people's well being and environment.This affects everyone,not just few.Moreover, global electricity use is rising rapidly.In a nutshell,without a stable electricity supply ,
    countries will notbe able to power their economies.<br>
    Energy  has become a focal point for security,climate changes,food production and the challenges was face today.
    It is also generates sustainable energy opportunities.
    <br>
    A proactive health benifits can be achieved through a good access to electricity.
    Therefore,a significant imrovement in well-being can be achieved.
</p>

<h7>Energy is the  dominant contributor to climate change</h7>

<h3>How many people are living without electricity?</h3>

<p>
    Just under one bilion people of the world's population don't have access to electricity.
    16 out of 20 countries with the largest deficits in electricity access are in Africa.

   <br>
Without electricity,women and girls have to spend hours fetching water,
clinics can'tstore vaccines for children,many schoolchildrencan't do homework at night,
and peoplecan't run competitive businesses.
<br>
The health and well-being of some 3 billion people  are adversely impacted by the lack of clean cooking fuels, such as wood ,charrcoal,dung and coal,which causes indoor air pollution.
<h3>What would it cost toswitch to more sustainable energy?</h3>
<p>Infrastructure,communications and high-technology.Conversely,lack of acccess toeneergy suppplies and transformation systen 
is a constraint to human and economic development.
</p>
<h3>I have access to electricity.Why should I care about this goal?</h3>
<p> For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal,oil or gas have been major sources of electricity  produces large amounts of The worldneeds to triple its investment in susttainable energy infrastructure per year,from around $400 bilion now
     to $1.25 trillion by 2030.
     <br>
     Regions with the greatest energy deficits Sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia -nee our help to improve energy access.
     That includes pushing harder to find clean,efficient,and affordable alternatives to health-damaging cook stoves.

</p>
        <h3> What can we do to fix these issues?</h3>
        <p>Countries can acceelerate the transition to an affordable,reliable,and sustainable energy system by investing  in renewable energy resourses,prioritizing energy efficient practices,and adopting clean energy techologes andinfrrastructure.
            <br>
            Businesses canmaintain and protected ecosystems to be able to use and further develop hydropower sources of electricity and bioenergy,andcommit to sourcing 100%
            of operational electricity needs from renewable sources.
            <br>

            Employers can reduce the internal demand for transport by prioritizing telecommunications and incentivize less energy intensive modes such as train travel over auto and air travel.
            <br>
            Inventors can invest more in sustainable energy services,bringing new technologies
             to the  market quickly from a diverse supplier base.
             <br>
             You can save electricity by plugging appliances into a power strip and turning them off completely when not 
             in use,including yoour computer.
             takepublic transport to reduce carbon emissions.
