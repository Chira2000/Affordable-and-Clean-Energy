        Briefly explanation of the energy of Sri Lanka  
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sri Lanka has over 98% coverage of domestic electricity supply. 53% of total primary energy supply is accounted for by renewable sources. Rising dependency on imports and cost of energy can be viewed as challenges

    <p>
        When talking about the current use and supply of energy in Sri Lanka; Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar also use energy sources such as water, biomass waves and ocean thermal energy to harness energy in Sri Lanka.99.3% of Sri Lanka receives electricity.  But some sections of the country do not have access to electricity.  For example, the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, the only coal power plant in Sri Lanka, supplies approximately 40% of the electricity demand.  But the problem of the quality of the power supply arises because of the frequent power outages of the people nearby.
