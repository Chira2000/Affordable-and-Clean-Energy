        AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY</h1>
    <p>
        “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, Sustainability and modern energy for all.”
    </p>
    <h2>
        Briefly explanation of the energy of Sri Lanka  
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sri Lanka has over 98% coverage of domestic electricity supply. 53% of total primary energy supply is accounted for by renewable sources. Rising dependency on imports and cost of energy can be viewed as challenges
    </p>
    </div>


    <p>
        When talking about the current use and supply of energy in Sri Lanka; Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar also use energy sources such as water, biomass waves and ocean thermal energy to harness energy in Sri Lanka.99.3% of Sri Lanka receives electricity.  But some sections of the country do not have access to electricity.  For example, the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, the only coal power plant in Sri Lanka, supplies approximately 40% of the electricity demand.  But the problem of the quality of the power supply arises because of the frequent power outages of the people nearby.
    </p>
    <h2>
        TARGET and INDICATOR of SDG 7
    </h2>
    <p>
        By 2016, the number of power outages was less than a billion, but demand for energy increased as the population continued to grow.  The climate also changed slightly as people became accustomed to relying on fossil fuels.  To achieve the targets set by SDG 7 by 2030; It is important to ensure quality energy supply to all the people of the country and to increase productivity by increasing investment in solar, wind and thermal energy.  To should be provide clean and efficient energy services in Sri Lanka as well as in every country in the world by expanding the infrastructure and developing technology to help the environment around us generate energy
