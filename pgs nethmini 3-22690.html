    <h2>Why don't we use more renewable energy?</h2>
    <p><b>
        With regard to renewable energy sources, it is a widely held opinion that they are in many ways better for the 
        environment than non-renewable, fossil fuel sources.  They do not require the same level of extraction as fossil fuels, 
        but if some of them are considered "pure," it means that they have no effect on 
        the earth in converting them into electricity.</b>
        <p style=" color:blue;"><b> "In each case, they have seized it, despite obstacles we can scarcely imagine."</p>
        </P>
        <p><b> The transition to renewable energy not only means that a group of people will choose a new way to empower their homes,
             but that entire companies will need to re-evaluate how they make their money and where they get their energy from.
               Millions of homes, schools, businesses, public buildings and transportation hubs will need to be set up - 
               this will not happen overnight.
        </b></p>
        <p><b> Currently, renewable energy sources account for about 8% of U.S. energy consumption and about 14% of global energy needs.  
            This is primarily due to the fact that technology has taken time to develop to produce large quantities of clean energy,
             and many of our engines and systems have been developed to be fossil fuel-free.</b></p>
