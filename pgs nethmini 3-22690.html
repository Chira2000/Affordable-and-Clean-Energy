    <h2>Why don't we use more renewable energy?</h2>
    <p><b>
        With regard to renewable energy sources, it is a widely held opinion that they are in many ways better for the 
        environment than non-renewable, fossil fuel sources.  They do not require the same level of extraction as fossil fuels, 
        but if some of them are considered "pure," it means that they have no effect on 
        the earth in converting them into electricity.</b>
        <p style=" color:blue;"><b> "In each case, they have seized it, despite obstacles we can scarcely imagine."</p>
        </P>
        <p><b> The transition to renewable energy not only means that a group of people will choose a new way to empower their homes,
             but that entire companies will need to re-evaluate how they make their money and where they get their energy from.
               Millions of homes, schools, businesses, public buildings and transportation hubs will need to be set up - 
               this will not happen overnight.
        </b></p>
        <p><b> Currently, renewable energy sources account for about 8% of U.S. energy consumption and about 14% of global energy needs.  
            This is primarily due to the fact that technology has taken time to develop to produce large quantities of clean energy,
             and many of our engines and systems have been developed to be fossil fuel-free.</b></p>
             <h2 style="color:red;">Why do we make better use of solar Energy?</h2>

             <p><b>Solar power may be healthier for the planet, but that doesn't mean it is entirely reliable. 
                 While that can sound crazy  the sun shines in some form every day, right?  it's because the solar panels we have can 
                 only generate electricity when itâ€™s a clear sunny day.</b></p>

<p><b>In order for a home or business to rely entirely on solar power, the owners would need to live in a sunny area and use batteries
     to store excess energy for cloudy and rainy days. While technology is advancing quickly and some scientists are having success
      with panels that can generate energy even on overcast days, this obviously is not sustainable enough yet to fuel a nation.</b></p>

<p><b>Installing solar panels on our homes  and anywhere else  is also a costly exercise, and so while we will likely
     see more new buildings go up with solar panels on their roofs, it will be a while before there are enough to contribute 
     significantly to the power grid.</b>
     <p><b>What we can do in the meantime, though, is take a closer look at our individual efforts. Companies such as Inspire 
         are committed to creating a world powered by renewable energy and making the switch as easy as possible. Learn more about
          Inspire and how we're a renewable energy company dedicated to providing
          clean energy in homes.</b></p>

<h2 style="color:rgb(180, 40, 117);" >Where Do most forms of Renewable energy come from?</h2>
<p><b>Renewable energy sources are typically derived from natural resources that will not deplete over time. They offer a more 
    sustainable option, but are newer and typically more expensive to install than fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil. 
    Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and tidal energy come from the wind, the sun, and the sea, respectively.</b></p>

   <p><b> Other less-green renewable sources are also used, such as biomass fuel. This is made by farming by-products and natural
     materials that we throw away. While burning these still creates harmful gases, sourcing them is easy and there will always
      be more of it.</b></p>
